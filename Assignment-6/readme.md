# A6: README

**1. Briefly share your design process for this assignment. What graphic or graphics did you choose, from what decade? How did you try to style your "art page" to reflect your exploration of this decade's design trends?

  * For this assignment, being a 90's baby I decided to stick with the theme. For the graphic element of this assignment I used the palm tree with geometric lines going trough it, and then mirror it across the bottom of the page. I also used the sun like element, it reminded me of a sunset, and I overlaid this on top of my color boxes and above the palm trees.

**2. Describe your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes

  * I fell like in the 90's there were a lot of blues, reds, pinks, yellows so I used all of these in mine. For the colored overlaying boxes I choose blue as box 1 then yellow for the inner and red in box mixing these colors allowed for more orange and purple to come out to. then for my text I used a dark blue and fuchsia.

This assignment for me I found to be a bit difficult .I'm not to sure why just getting comfortable with css I guess. however I do feel very accomplished and feel more comfortable and ready to move on with the next assignment.
