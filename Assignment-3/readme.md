After messing around with HTML a little bit on the last assignment I felt way more comfortable diving into this one. Still I struggled learning the new techniques, I constantly was going back and fourth trough the course material and even referencing my last assignment a bit. But overall this was challenging but rewarding to finish and getting everything to work out on the page was really exciting.
