# Project1: MY FIRST WEBPAGE
***
A's to Q's:

1. When Browsing the internet I generally use google chrome or Firefox. I will be honest I'm not entirely sure why I use one or the other, besides they are both open source web browser's and one supports certain web based programs better then other.
2. The way back Machine was a fun little tool to compare how far we have come with web design and building. I went and compared a site that I sadly use almost everyday, Facebook. I took a look at the 1998 version and compared it to now, Really not a ton has changed. The login is about the same there is a lot of white space and since the 1998 version we have made it grey instead but a lot of extra room still. Also now when you log in and out it remembers tour account so you can just click on your picture if there are more than one accounts being used on the same computer. Where before that space was filled with a graphic of a flat world map.
3. Starting this project was super frustrating to me at first. I just got a tiny bit comfortable with markdown and then we switched to html. There are a just a lot of little extra steps and symbols that made it hard at first but as soon as I got something to properly work in my purview I just got so excited and felt really accomplished.
