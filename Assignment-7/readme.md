1. Briefly share your design process for this assignment. What fonts did you choose, and why?

  * For this assignment I choose the excerpt from the Princess Bride. One of my all time favorite movies, and books, I thought that this would have a lot of room for creativity within the fonts and colors. For my font headings I choose the font PHILOSOPHER, This one reminded me of a font that might get used in a fair tail teamed book, it has an aged script type font that I really liked. And for my body I used the font NICONNE this also has a very whimsical feel to it but more flowy and elegant.

2. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font? What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?

  *  System Font: System fonts are fonts that are already installed on a device. These fonts may not always be available to the web. These are least favorable when working on logos or web pages or sharable documents.

  *  Web Font: Web fonts are fonts that are known by to be available to a system. so available to all system, Mac or PC, however these font may take longer to load.

  *  Fallback Font: Super important to have a fallback font, these are fonts that if your original font cannot be displayed on a users device then a "fallback" or next runner up font will show instead.

I really enjoyed learning about typography in web design. at first it was a bit trick to get my font to work but that was just me not paying attention and forgetting silly things like commas. Besides the small things I was able to move right along with this assignment, adding to my too box and practicing old tricks.
