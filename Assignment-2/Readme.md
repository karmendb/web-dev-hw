# Assignment 2   

A *version control system* is a system that helps record and save new changes made to a file over time. This allows you to go back and recall different versions of that file. This system is used all of the time in many different ways. In this class we use it a lot while working on assignments. We are constantly getting to point where we need to save and upload out work. really we use it in nearly every file on our computers.

Here are my [Responses](https://github.com/karmendb/web-dev-hw/blob/master/Assignment-2/Responses.txt) for internet protocol.

This assignment was a bit difficult and rewarding for me for these reasons....
* This is still a very new program to me so just even looking at it was still a bit forging.
* Remembering all of the different markdown language and going back to look things up.
* Learning a whole new language and understanding a little bit better what it takes to make the this all happen is pretty interesting.
