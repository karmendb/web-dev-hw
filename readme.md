I have decided to take this class because I am an art major and a media arts minor, and I am interested in learning how to build a website to show off my work.

But what exactly is the internet? I was really interested in learning about..
* The Internet was created by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn.
* The Internet was the result of anther project they were working on called the Apanet.
* Simply the internet is just a wire that is sending and sharing information from one point to another.
