1. What is "alt text," and why do we use it?
 * alternative text attribute "alt text" is used to label and provide a text description of an image. Whenever a viewer is unable to look at a picture the alt text should appear.

2. Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?
 * Many of the forms that I come across on the internet are much like what we have worked through in this assignment. lots of table and dropdown selection tabs and areas to write text into. a bit more technical form that I often see and use on the internet is checking out when you purchase something online. It hurts my head to think about writing the code for those pages, making sure card transactions go through and the order go through and the customer gets their purchase.

This Project I really enjoyed learning about how forms work in html. I found this project to be frustrating and difficult but by the end I now think I have a base understanding about how to implement these forms into my own work someday. The hardest part for me was making the table towards the end. I finally got it all laid out, went to check it and everything looked good except no line at all. I was so frustrated because I followed everything exactly.. so I though. I went back to the course website and complete forgot that you need to tell the head what your doing when making a table. The moment when you finish a project and then go to view it and it all works is so good...my dog  probably thinks I'm crazy with how much I talk to myself and how excited I get after all of these projects.
